#Rationale 

- Using Vue.js CLI V3 as it will create the build scripts for the project, so I can spend more time developing the challenge
- I focused on the functionality rather then the design so I could have it done in a few hours
- I added Jest into the project and wrote tests before creating a function in robotUtils to ensure it was working as expect. Check out the test /test/robotUtils.js.
- I use SCSS for the styling and tried to stick to BEM syntax to ensure some standards where accross the project

## What I would do if I had more time

- Clean up the App.vue file and split some of that functionality out. Such as the controllers.
- Make it look much prettier and maybe add some design and styling.
