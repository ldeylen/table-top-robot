# table-top-robot

Example Project is hosted here [https://ldeylen.github.io/](https://ldeylen.github.io/)

Read the document [Rationale](RATIONALE.md) for notes on thought process.

I have create an interface with two methods of how to control the application
- A button interface with forms to configure the instructions
- A text input interface which allows you to do a set of commands and watch them be played out in a sequence.
